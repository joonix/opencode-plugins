# OpenCode plugins

Small, independently installable OpenCode V2 plugins maintained in one Bun workspace.

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/reviewer` | Reviews permission requests with an LLM before prompting the user. |
| `packages/subagent-model` | Lets a parent select the model and reasoning variant for each subagent call. |

Each package can be installed by its directory path. Published packages remain independent even though they share this repository.

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    { "package": "/path/to/opencode-plugins/packages/reviewer", "options": {} },
    "/path/to/opencode-plugins/packages/subagent-model"
  ]
}
```
